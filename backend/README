When making a release the following steps should be taken:

1. Add the new version to src/index.xml

 The order of the releases and branches is significant. The first element is
 identified as the primary release or branch. So new releases should
 be *prepended* to a <branch/> element.

2. Collect the new (release) snapshots

 After the new release has been registered(src/index.xml), the
 collect_source_snapshots.py script will read that file to collect new source
 snapshots from github.

 $ python3 ./collect_source_snapshots.py

 This grabs the new tag's snapshot and creates the source
 distributions(zip, tbz2, tgz).

3. Add new distribution archives and commit changes.

 $ git add static/files
 $ git commit -a
 $ git push

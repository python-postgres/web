This project manages the website and release process of pg-python. It
attempts to simplify the process by providing the necessary instructions
and supporting scripts for a successful release.

Scripts and function:

	build
		constructs the site in ./root (does *not* clean).
	install
		rsyncs ./root to pgfoundry. publishes the build.
	clean
		remove the ./root directory.
	be-new
		collects the new source snapshots for the backend (pg-python).
	fe-new
		collects the new source snapshots for the frontend (py-postgresql).

To add a release, see the backend/README and frontend/README.

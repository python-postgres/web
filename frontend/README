When making a release the following steps should be taken:

1. Add the new version to src/index.xml

 The order of the releases and branches is significant. The first element is
 identified as the primary release or branch. So new releases should
 be *prepended* to a <branch/> element.

2. Collect the new (release) snapshots

 After the new release has been registered, the collect_source_snapshots.py
 script will read that file to collect new source snapshots from github.

 $ python3 ./collect_source_snapshots.py

 This grabs the new tag's snapshot and creates the source distributions.

3. Build binary distributions

 Using Wine:
  $ wine 'c:\python3x\python' setup.py build_ext --compiler=mingw32 build bdist_msi

 Or if you have a VM with VC++ installed:
  $ c:\python3x\python setup.py build bdist_msi

 Move the MSI into static/files:
  $ mv dist/*.msi static/files/

THE EXTENSION MODULE IS OPTIONAL,
SO BE SURE TO CHECK THE LOG TO VALIDATE
THAT COMPILATION DID NOT FAIL.

4. Add new distribution archives and commit changes.

 $ git add static/files
 $ git commit -a
 $ git push
